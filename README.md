## Phonological (and Orthographic rules) for Estonian
These are the phonological rules applied in the following order:-
- **Rule 1** \
b, d, g become /p, t, k/. p, t, k become long consonants and when written double, they become overly-long consonants. 
- **Rule 2** \
b, d, g are written as p, t, k before and after b, p, d, t, g, k, s, h, š, z, ž, f with etymological exceptions. 
- **Rule 3** \
Word initial h is omitted in speech. 
- **Rule 4** \
j is pronounced between i and a, but not written. üü is pronounced a /yij/. 
- **Rule 5** \
Vowels and consonants like h, j, l, m, n, r, s, v are pronounced as long consonants when written double. 
- **Rule 6 (orthographic)** \
Consonant clusters are disallowed except at morpheme boundaries. Another exception is s, which can occur after l, m, n, or r, if it's not followed by a consonant. 
- **Rule 7** \
Word-medial and word-final f and š are pronounced as long consonants when written single and as overly long consonants when written double. 
- **Rule 8** \
Alveolar consonants (except r) are palatalized if they occur before i or j.
